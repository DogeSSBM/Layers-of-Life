# Layers-of-Life

Multiple instances of cellular automata. Visually overlayed layers can optionally interact, merge, or ignore any other layer(s). Layers can be added or removed dynamically, programmed to resize, change rulesets, and much much more!
Written in C. Uses SDL2 and SDL2_ttf for graphics and keyboard input. Compiled and tested with GCC version 8.3.0 (Debian 8.3.0-6).
